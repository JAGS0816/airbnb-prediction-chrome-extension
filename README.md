# Airbnb Price Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict accommodation prices on Airbnb to identify whether a listing is offering a fair price or not. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, we explore various variables that may influence Airbnb accommodation prices, such as location, size, amenities, and the time of year.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress, and it's currently in the data analysis stage. Deployment of the predictive model is still pending.

## Contents

- **Data Analysis:** Exploration and visualization of data to better understand the relationships between variables and Airbnb prices.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning models to predict Airbnb prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of the accuracy and performance of the prediction models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, re
